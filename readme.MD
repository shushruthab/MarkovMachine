## Markov Machine Node App

## Project Details

The project involved writing an algorithm for generating realistic machine-made text from an original source text.

For example, if we feed in the source text of “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland”, we might get output like this:

‘You are old,’ said the Dormouse, who was talking. Alice could only see her. She is such a new pair of white kid gloves and the blades of grass, but she remembered the number of bathing machines in the kitchen that did not like the wind, and was just beginning to grow up any more if you’d like it put the Dormouse again, so she went nearer to make out that it was certainly English. ‘I don’t quite understand you,’ she said, ‘for her hair goes in such confusion that she was looking down with it.
(that text isn’t directly in the source book, but it’s built via an algorithm to be similar to the text in the book).

## Quick Start
```javascript
// Install dependencies
npm install

// Test MarkovMachine
jest 

// Run script
node makeText.js file eggs.txt
// generated text from file 'eggs.txt'
OR

node makeText.js url http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt
//generated text from that URL
```
